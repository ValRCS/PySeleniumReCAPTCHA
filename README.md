# PySeleniumReCAPTCHA
First attempt at working with Selenium to solve ReCAPTCHA

Will not be updated. I've moved away from Selenium due a wide range of issues and now automate Chrome directly through DevTools Protocol. Placing this here for others research and experimental purposes.

This does not solve the navigator.webdriver issue, sorry.
